# Trainer Mod for Half Sword Playtest
This is an experimental version of the trainer mod for Half Sword Playtest only.

For the Nov 2023 demo v0.3 use the [regular trainer mod](https://github.com/massclown/HalfSwordTrainerMod).

# How to install
Right now, the only way to install is manually. The one-click installer will need quite some work to support two games.

Follow the steps at https://github.com/massclown/HalfSwordTrainerMod?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-hard-mode 
but download **experimental** UE4SS from here:
https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases/download/experimental/UE4SS_v3.0.1-234-g4fc8691.zip
and now all the mod files go into a `ue4ss\Mods` subfolder inside the game's folder.

# Known issues and limitations
Unfortunately there is no user interface, just use the keybinds and check the logs. 

Most of the functionality from the regular trainer mod may still work.

Because there is no user interface, `F1` spawns random armor and `F2` spawns random weapons. 
Use the despawn keybind `F5` to despawn them if you don't like what you get.

Jump is now bound to `Numpad 5`, as `Space` is used by the game for kicking.
